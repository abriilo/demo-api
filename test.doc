I have my personal server and I deploy it there. Here https://creative-tim.abraham-mitiku.com
and for the backend source code. Here https://github.com/abriilo/demo-api , I stated necessary read me informations there.
1. front end connected with backend.
2. signup (register new user)
3. verify (demo) user
4. login (redirect authorized users to dashboard) 
5. update profile (name, email, password)
